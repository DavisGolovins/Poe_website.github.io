            <p>Atlas passive skills are skill trees specific to the Atlas of Worlds, introduced in the Echoes of the Atlas expansion. Progressing The Maven's questline allows the player to unlock these powerful passive skills that enhance the rewards and fights of maps within the Atlas of Worlds. A complete list of the available passive skills is located below. Up to 10 points can be earned per region, with the exception of The Uncharted Realms where 12 points can be earned.

                The Orb of Unmaking
                allows players to refund Atlas passive points, and these orbs drop commonly from The Maven's challenges.
                
                There is an Atlas Quick Guide that covers all the steps to unlock the complete The Maven's Challenge and unlock the Atlas passive skill tree. </p>
